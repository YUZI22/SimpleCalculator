# Simplecalc
This is a project, in which will be a simple calculator that will be developed. In this project I will try to learn more about python, anyone can contribute to make it better. Right now I have got the main code from this website: 
https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/examples/calculator

If anyone wants to contribute to the code that will make me more than happy. 
I will also be testing stuff as I go along to help my understanding of this. Like how variables work etc.. (remember I'm no expert)
